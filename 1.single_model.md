# Trying to train with existing model framework

In this section, I tried [ResNet50](1_1_resnet50_mura.ipynb) and [DenseNet201](1_3_densenet_mura.ipynb), both trained from scratch on MURA datasets, and used adam naively with default parameters.

Learnings:
1. need to use `ImageDataGenerator`, or else the model memorizes all input images very quickly (training accuracy > 0.99 while validation accuracy ~0.5).
2. Model converges very slowly when optimizing using default parameters, and the performance is not good enough when it does converge.
