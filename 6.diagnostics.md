# Model Diagnostics

With model trained from 5_1, we can do more diagnostics to see what in the data make our model perform good/bad.

Finds:
- the color on some images are flipped (instead of having bright bones and dark backgrounds, some had dark bones and bright backgrounds).
- The existence of bone locking plates is not entirely indicative of anomaly. The organizer said that if the problem the plates are fixing is no longer there, then it's considered normal instead of abnormal.

Next Steps:
- Inspect activation pattern at the beginning and end of each dense block
- Saliency map for model activation - what is my model paying attention to?
